This prebuilt version of the gcc 6.0 compiler for the HSA branch can be installed with the following commands.

   mkdir git
   cd git
   git clone https://github.com/HSAFoundatin/hsa-openmp-gcc-amd
   sudo rsync -aHv  hsa-openmp-gcc-amd/usr/local/hsagccver /usr/local
   sudo ln -sf /usr/local/hsagccver/hsagcc.XXXXX /usr/local/hsagcc

The compiler will be installed at /usr/local/hsagcc.   
In anticipation of future versions of this comiler, the directory /usr/local/hsagcc is a symbolic link
to a build in /usr/local/hsagccver. Future builds will be added to the directory hsagccver and 
the symbolic link will change so that the most recent version is visible from /usr/local/hsagcc.

Change XXXXXX to the latest directory name in /usr/local/hsagccver.  For example, substitute hsagcc.XXXXX with hsagcc.228142C.


After the first time you clone hsa-openmp-gcc-amd, use these commands when a new compiler version is available. 

   cd git/hsa-openmp-gcc-amd
   git pull
   sudo rsync -aHv usr/local/hsagccver /usr/local
   sudo ln -sf /usr/local/hsagccver/hsagcc.XXXXX /usr/local/hsagcc
