This prebuilt version of the gcc 6.0 compiler for the HSA branch can be installed with the following commands.

   mkdir git
   cd git
   git clone https://github.com/HSAFoundatin/hsa-openmp-gcc-amd
   sudo rsync -aC hsa-openmp-gcc-amd/usr/local /usr

The compiler will be installed at /usr/local/hsagcc
In anticipation of future versions of this comiler, the directory /usr/local/hsagcc is a symbolic link
to a build in /usr/local/hsagccver. Future builds will be added to the directory hsagccver and 
the symbolic link will change so that the most recent version is visible from /usr/local/hsagcc.
