#  Commands to build hsagcc branch from scratch. 
#
#  Warnings: 
#  1.  The GCC 6.0 HSA branch is in development, you could get a garbage build.   
#      The builds we save in usr/local/hsagccver have some level of functionality. 
#
#  2.  This is short script but two commands take a very long time.
#      I recommend you drag and drop these commands to your linux command prompt.
#
#  3.  GCC may be transitioning from svn to git.  Adjust accordingly.
#
#      Thank you for being patient.
